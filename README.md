# Tap_Out_Exercise_Tracker

This is a fitness tracking app that allows a user to view and create daily workouts. The User can log multiple workouts. The user is also able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, the user should be able to track the distance traveled. To create the app, a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handle routes with Express have been created.


## Functionality

When the user loads the page, they should be given the option to create a new workout or continue with their last workout.

The user should be able to:

  * Add exercises to the most recent workout plan.

  * Add new exercises to a new workout plan.

  * View the combined weight of multiple exercises from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.

  * View the total duration of each workout from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.



To deploy an application with a MongoDB database to Heroku, you'll need to set up a MongoDB Atlas account and connect a database from there to your application. Be sure to use the following guides for support:

  * [Set Up MongoDB Atlas](../04-Important/MongoAtlas-Setup.md)

  * [Deploy with Heroku and MongoDB Atlas](../04-Important/MongoAtlas-Deploy.md)
